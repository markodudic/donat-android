    <string name="indication_1_desc">Donat Mg is a natural osmotic laxative. It contains sulphate salts and about 1000 mg/l of magnesium. Sulphate ions have a considerable ability to bond with water, which increases the volume of intestinal content by 3 to 5 times, triggering intestinal peristalsis.</string>
    <string name="indication_2_desc">Thanks to its approximately 7800 mg of hydrogen carbonate, Donat Mg has a great capacity for bonding with acids and buffering free acids. With its alkaline effect, the sodium hydrogen carbonate in Donat Mg has an anti-inflammatory effect on the stomach lining. Furthermore, the magnesium and calcium found alongside the sodium reduce the swelling of the stomach lining.</string>
    <string name="indication_3_desc">Donat Mg is richer in magnesium than any other natural mineral water.* The recommended daily intake of this mineral is about 375 mg. An increased need for magnesium occurs during pregnancy and nursing as well as during the period of fast growth in adolescence. A greater lack of magnesium and, consequently, its increased need occur in elderly people, in people with metabolic disorders, in people taking certain medicines or following diets and in stressful periods. It is easier for the body to absorb it from water than from food. The magnesium in mineral water is immediately available to the body and is able to quickly participate in metabolic processes.&lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;i>*The examined comparative results include all recognised natural mineral waters available on the market and registered in the EU.&lt;/i></string>
    <string name="indication_4_desc">A magnesium deficiency in people with type 2 diabetes occurs due to the increased loss of magnesium through urine. All patients (including pregnant women) affected by diabetes mellitus for the first time suffer from blood sugar imbalances and an improper functioning of insulin. By drinking Donat Mg, it is possible to compensate the magnesium and better manage the disease, reducing the oscillations in blood sugar levels. </string>
    <string name="indication_5_desc">The bile of those whose stones have been surgically removed contains too much cholesterol or too few bile acids and lecithin. The bile that accumulates in the gallbladder is thicker, making it impossible for the gallbladder to empty completely. The magnesium sulphate in Donat Mg speeds up bile secretion. Regular evacuation of the gallbladder thus prevents the formation of gall stones.</string>
    <string name="indication_6_desc">Thanks to its high levels of hydrogen carbonate and magnesium, Donat Mg prevents the formation of calcium oxalate stones, uric acid stones and cystine stones, which thrives in an acidic environment, in a natural way. Hydrogen carbonate and magnesium both have an impact on the regulation of the body’s alkaline-acid balance. The acid-binding hydrogen carbonate in particular provides a strong alkaline surplus, thus creating an alkaline environment that prevents the formation of these stones.</string>
    <string name="indication_7_desc">When on a diet, Donat Mg neutralises acids and replaces the lost minerals. It is very beneficial when we begin losing weight because it is a natural laxative and cleanses the body of toxins. The sulphate salts found in Donat Mg increase the secretion of cholecystokinin, which reduces appetite. Magnesium speeds up the metabolism, boosts immunity and increases energy reserves.</string>
    <string name="indication_8_desc">Donat Mg contains very little table salt and has consequently no effects on blood pressure. On the other hand, it contains high levels of magnesium (1000 mg/l). Magnesium is an essential element that, among other things, regulates the entire muscular system. Our heart is also a muscle that needs magnesium for its normal functioning. In order to prevent heart failure, arrhythmia and other disturbances that may be a consequence of magnesium deficiency, this important mineral has to be consumed on a daily basis.</string>
    <string name="indication_9_desc">Stress affects our psychological and physical health as the body loses more minerals through water. Consequently, the need for vitamins and minerals increases in stressful periods. Magnesium deficiency may even trigger certain types of headaches. Donat Mg is rich in this mineral, which is also called the anti-stress mineral and a salve for the nerves and muscles by the scientist.</string>
    <string name="indication_10_desc">Donat Mg is particularly rich in magnesium, sulphates and hydrogen carbonates, but also contains calcium, sodium and other microelements. As well as enriching your body with minerals, Donat Mg helps regulate the body’s alkaline-acid balance thanks to a high hydrogen carbonate content. You can drink it all your life to improve your health and general well-being.</string>
    <string name="indication_11_desc">When consumed in accordance with the Detox Mg programme - a comprehensive detox programme that includes diet, body care, physical activity and techniques for unlocking your thoughts - Donat Mg helps detoxify the body. Learn more about the programme at &lt;a href="http://www.detox.eu/">www.detoxmg.eu&lt;/a>.&lt;br>&lt;br>Donat Mg contains 7800 mg of bicarbonate and over 1000 mg of magnesium per litre. Bicarbonates have a base effect and neutralise excess acid, thus helping establish acid-base balance in the body. Sulphates in the form of magnesium and sodium salts are able to bond with large quantities of water, giving Donat Mg the properties of a natural osmotic laxative. Sulphate matter also increases cholecystokinin secretion, which reduces appetite. Donat Mg therefore helps you to follow the dietary guidelines of the programme.</string>
